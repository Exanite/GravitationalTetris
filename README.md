# Gravitational Tetris

This game was made for the [DevLUp 2023 Wargames game jam](https://itch.io/jam/devlup-fall-23-wargames) and can be found here on [Itch.io](https://exanite.itch.io/gravitational-tetris)!

The theme was **Upside-Down**.

## How to play

Instead of directly controlling the Tetris shapes, you control them by moving your character. \
Additionally, clearing tiles is done by **matching colors** instead of creating a full row of tiles.

WASD to move. \
QE to rotate. \
Space to reverse gravity *and* place block.
